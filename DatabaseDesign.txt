Database
- Systematic collection of data
- store and manipulate data in a systematic way

Types of databases
- Relational Database
- Object Oriented Database
- Centralized Database
- Hierarchical Database
- Cloud Database
- Network Database

DBMS - Database Management System

Flat File System vs DBMS

RDBMS
- Relational DBMS

Relational Model
Relation - Table
Table - collection of row and col

Relational Model Concepts
- Attribute 	- column
- Tuple				- row
- Degree				- total number of attributes
- Cardinality	- total number of tuple
- Attribute domain - each col has pre-defined value and scope


SQL - Type of RDBMS

DDL		- Data Definition Language
DML		- Data Manipulation Language
DCL		- Data Control Language
TCL		- Transaction Control Language
DQL		- Data Query Language

SQL is an ANSI standard language


Database Design
- Logical Design
- Physical Design

Database Design Techniques
- Normalization - used to remove redundancy of data
	NF - Normal Form
	- 1NF 
			Rule 1 - each table cell should contain single value
			Rule 2 - each records needs to be unique
	- 2NF
			Rule 1 - it should be in 1NF
			Rule 2 - Primary key does not functionally dependent on any subset of candidate key
	- 3NF
		Rule 1 - it should be in 2NF
		Rule 2 - no transitive functional dependencies
	- 3.5NF / BCNF - Boyce Codd NF
		- if there are still some anomalies left then we use BCNF
	- 4NF
	- 5NF
	- 6NF

Keys
- Primary Key 
	- it cannot be null
	- it is always unique
- Foreign Key
	- it referes to primary key from another table
- Unique Key
	- it is also unique, but it can be null
- Candidate Key
	- group of attributes that can be uniquely identify
- Super Key
	- single key or a group of multiple keys

Emp Table -> Emp_ID, Emp_Name, Emp_Email
					->  (Emp_ID, Emp_Email), (Emp_ID, Emp_Name)
